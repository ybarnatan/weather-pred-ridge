🌦️ Weather Prediction with Ridge Regression

---

### ✅ Introduction
This project is a practical exercise in applying machine learning to weather prediction using a regularized linear model (Ridge Regression). While real-world meteorological models are far more complex and data-intensive, this example illustrates how basic machine learning techniques can be used to explore and model weather-related variables.

### 📊 Project Objectives

+ Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical weather data
+ Build a Ridge Regression model to predict a target weather variable 

---

### 💻 Tech Stack

+ Python

+ Jupyter Notebook

+ Libraries:  `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `google.colab`

---

📌 Key Features


+ Clean and well-documented code

+ Tidying data

+ Simple prediction

📉 Limitations & Notes


This is a simplified model and doesn’t incorporate dynamic weather simulations or atmospheric physics.

The goal is not to build a production-level weather forecaster, but to practice regression modeling, EDA, and critical thinking around model assumptions and generalization.
