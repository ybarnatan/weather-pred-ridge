âœ… Introduction

First attempt using a machine learning linear model to attempt weather prediction. Check the `Weather_prediction_Ridge_Regression.ipynb` file!

ðŸ“Š Aim

Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and attempt a humble weather prediction. Feel free to explore adding more variables and trying this code on the dataset gathered from the city you live in!

ðŸ’» Stack

For this project, I used Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter notebook, Pandas
