âœ… Introduction

First attempt using a machine learning linear model to attempt weather prediction. Check the `Weather_prediction_Ridge_Regression.ipynb` file! Bear in mind that "our forays into data donâ€™t always result in earth-shattering revelations. Sometimes they do, but most of the time they donâ€™t. Thatâ€™s part of the job." (Cassie Kozyrkov)

ðŸ“Š Aim

Perform exploratory analysis on the dataset and attempt a humble weather prediction. Feel free to explore adding more variables and trying this code on the dataset gathered from the city you live in!

ðŸ’» Stack

For this project, I used Python, Scikit-learn, Jupyter notebook, Pandas
